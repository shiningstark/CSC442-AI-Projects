Project 1 of CSC 442
@autohr Xingxing Li


1: This is a sole project for me and the first time I use Java, so there may be many inappropriate sentences. 
2: To run the Game, Just Run the main function in 
	Basic TTT.java Part 1
	Super TTT.java Part 2
	ULtimate TTT.java Part3
   For part 2 and part 3, in the main function thers is an variable called depth which decides the max depth that AI algorithm will search.You could change it(deafult value now is 9 and 3 for Part 2 and Part 3, repectively).

3: The HMinMax.class is to implement hMinMax and alpha beta pruning.

4: For terminal input, format of player's move should be as following:
	1(position) Part 1
	1(board) 7(position) Part 2 & Part 3
	Just separate the board and position by a white space, do not 
	use comma or something else as the delimeter

5: The whole project is esatabileh under the Java, use IntelliJ as the IDE, it is a better idea to run the code in same IDE.

6: All source files are under 'Source Fils' folder, you could directly create a project in IntelliJ based on this folder.Other folder contains some IntelliJ project supprt files.(Another option is to place src and .idea in same folder and create a new Project)

7: If there is something wrong with my code(such as the game could not go smoothly), please contact me at rgao9@ur.rochester.edu
