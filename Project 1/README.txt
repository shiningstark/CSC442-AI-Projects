Project 1 of CSC 442
@autohr Xingxing Li


1: This is a sole project for me and the first time I use Java, so there may be many inappropriate sentences. 

2: To run the Game, Just Run the main function called tictactoe.java in 3 different folders
   For part 2 and part 3, in the GameTree function thers is a variable called depth which decides the max depth that AI algorithm will search. You can change it by ur ownself. The larger number,  the smarter AI is.

3: The HMinMax.class is to implement hMinMax and alpha beta pruning.

4. More details about how to run code and how to make operation are in writeup.pdf.

5: The whole project is esatabileh under the Java, use IntelliJ as the IDE, it is a better idea to run the code in same IDE.

6: If there is something wrong with my code(such as the game could not go smoothly), please contact me at rgao9@ur.rochester.edu
